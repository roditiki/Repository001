Method for Spatiotemporal Power Profile from Wind Energy for a Proposed U.S.-Caribbean Super Grid under  Hurricanes in North America
1. Project's Title: Method for Wind power profile estimation under hurricanes 


2. Project Description
The literature on extreme wind energy assessment covers the issues related to the prediction 
of hurricane track, intensity, and structure; the prediction of the economic damage caused by 
hurricane landfalls. Most of the literature regarding the impact of hurricanes on energy 
generation is concerned with the mechanical effects of hurricanes on wind turbine structures 
(for example, towers and blades), overhead transmission lines, and damage to wind turbines 
not certified to withstand hurricanes and typhoons. In 2021, wind turbine manufacturers (GE 
Renewables, Vestas, and Siemens-Gamesa) obtained certification for hurricane-proof 
turbines. The existing literature about the impact of hurricanes and published before 2021 
considers that wind turbines are not resistant to hurricanes. A new tool is needed to realistically 
generate wind power profiles for power system studies even at high winds from hurricanes, 
because the hurricane-proof turbines do not break down like previous generations of fragile 
wind turbines.

I and the coauthors proposed an method and algorithm to estimate the total power profile of several 
wind turbines distributed on a region, and interconnected by high voltage power grid. 
The proposed algorithm was implemented in MATLAB coding.
